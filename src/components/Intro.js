        The body mass index (BMI) or Quetelet index is a value derived
        from the mass (weight) and height of an individual. The BMI is
        defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height,
        and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass
        in kilograms and height in meters.
